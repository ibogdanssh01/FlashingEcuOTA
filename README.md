# FlashingEcuOTA

FlashingEcuOTA is a project aimed at enabling over-the-air (OTA) firmware flashing for Electronic Control Units (ECUs), specifically targeting automotive applications. The project is divided into two main components:

- **ATMEGA328 Project**:  
  Contains firmware and bootloader code for the ATmega328 microcontroller, which is commonly used in embedded systems. This module handles the reception of firmware updates and manages the flashing process.

- **Python Project**:  
  Includes scripts and tools written in Python to control and manage the OTA update process. This module handles communication with the ECU, firmware update delivery, diagnostics, and monitoring.

## Key Features
- Secure and reliable OTA firmware updates for automotive ECUs
- Python-based control and monitoring tools
- C embedded code for microcontroller firmware flashing
- Modular design for easy adaptation to different vehicle platforms
- Documentation and setup guides included

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (approx. 92.8%): For the main control tools and communication protocols.
- **C** (approx. 7.2%): For embedded system code targeting the ATmega328 microcontroller.

## Setup
Please refer to `Setup.docx` for detailed setup instructions, including software dependencies, hardware connections, and usage guidelines.

## Documentation
Comprehensive project documentation can be found in `Project documentation.docx`.
